[Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/) is a high-level programming language is used in everything from AI/machine learning to data science to websites. Over the past
few years, Python has become the most popular programming language ([Tiobe Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)) due to how fast and easy it is to use. You see, Python 
abstracts all the low-level aspects of writing code away from the programmer so they can do whatever they need to without worrying about the internals. You don't have to worry
about managing memory, declaring types for variables, or sizes for arrays. Python is meant to be one thing above all else: **simple**.
