# Interest Meeting

# Club Structure
- Meetings are now Wednesdays at 5:00pm
- Club is now composed of 3 smaller clubs (programming, cybersecurity, competitive programming)
- Need for treasurer, backup SGA representative, and leader for programming and competitive programming subclubs (freshmen welcome!)
- Every week, the main club will focus on one of the three subclubs
- The last week of every month is reserved for social events (with the HPU Minds club)
- Added Python support to better integrate with the department and be more welcoming for freshmen

# Subclubs
Subclubs are exactly what they sound like: smaller, unofficial clubs under the C.O.D.E. Club. The three subclubs are cybersecurity, competitive programming, and
programming. Each week, the main club will focus on one of the three subclubs. HPU Minds is an independent club.

## The Cybersecurity Club
Leader: Reilly

- Heavily based around a feedback loop of competiting in cyber CTFs/Hackathons and then reviewing the write-ups
    1. Seasonal competitions (NCL, CSAW, PicoCTF)
    2. Year-round Practice Ranges (PicoCTF Range, NCL Gymnasium, CTFtime)
- Centralized cyber repository for storing write-ups and organizing notes
