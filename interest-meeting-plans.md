# Interest Meeting

# Club Structure
- Meetings are now Tuesdays at 5:00pm (potentially Wednesday instead)
- Club is now composed of 3 smaller clubs (programming, cybersecurity, competitive programming)
- Need for treasurer, backup SGA representative, and leader for programming and competitive programming subclubs (freshmen welcome!)
- Every week, the main club will focus on one of the three subclubs
- The last week of every month is reserved for social events (with the HPU Minds club)
- Added Python support to better integrate with the department and be more welcoming for freshmen

# Subclubs
Subclubs are exactly what they sound like: smaller clubs under the C.O.D.E. Club
