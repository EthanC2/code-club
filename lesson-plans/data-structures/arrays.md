# Data Structures: Arrays
An array is one of the most primitive but powerful data structures. An array is just a series of variables of some type (e.g. `int`, `char`, `double`) declared back to back
in memory. These variables (called elements) can be individually accessed with their [index](https://js.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-access-the-elements-of-an-array-by-index-number-in-cpp), which
is a number that represents their position in 

```C++

# Arrays as a Physical Data Structure
An array is an example of a [physical data structure](https://www.udemy.com/tutorial/datastructurescncpp/physical-vs-logical-data-structures/),
