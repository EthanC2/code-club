# An Introduction to Linked Lists
Linked lists a physical data structure that stores a list of elements as series of connected nodes. Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list.
The last node in the list points to `NULL`. Since each node is dynamically allocated, linked lists do not have a max size and can be re-sized dynamically so they only take
up as much memory as needed. However, this means that arrays do not support [random access](https://inside.caratlane.com/arrays-understanding-the-random-access-3d07983b20ca)
because the memory is not contiguous.
