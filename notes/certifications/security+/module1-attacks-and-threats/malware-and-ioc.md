# Malware and Indicators of Compromise

# What is Malware?
Malware is any software that is used maliciously \[[1](https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/malware.html)\]\[[2](https://www.avg.com/en/signal/what-is-malware)\]\[[3](https://cybernews.com/malware/)\]. 
'Malicous' typically means some illegal activity like accessing/deleing secret information or crippling a system with a denial of service, but really malware is any software 
that accesses/modifies a computer without permission \[[1](https://definitions.uslegal.com/m/malware/)\]. For example, in 2005 Sony got into trouble for bundling a 
copy-protection software with their CDs \[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal)\]. 
When inserted, the CDs would install a [rootkit](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/rootkit) on the operating system level that would prevent the user from
copying the CD. The modification was not mentioned in the [EULA](https://www.servicenow.com/products/it-asset-management/what-is-eula.html) and also introducted
vulnerabilites that other malware exploited. Naturally, the copy-protection was deemed malware and resulted in multiple class-action lawsuits. The most important take-away
was that all of these things were done _without consent_.

Malware is usually intentionally malicious, trying to hide their actions from the OS and anti-malware as to not get caught.

## Virus
A virus is malware that contains a [payload](https://malwiki.org/index.php?title=Payload)\[[1](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/payload)\]\[[2](https://malware.fandom.com/wiki/Payload)\]. 
The primary function of a virus is to propagate itself by binding itself to a host like a link, pdf, zip, or word file. Because viruses can only be spread through
interaction with the host they are binded to, viruses *require* user interaction.
