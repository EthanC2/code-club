# Malware and Indicators of Compromise
Malware is any software that is used maliciously \[[1](https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/malware.html)\]\[[2](https://www.avg.com/en/signal/what-is-malware)\]\[[3](https://cybernews.com/malware/)\]. 
'Malicous' typically means some illegal activity like accessing/deleing secret information or crippling a system with a denial of service, but really malware is any software 
that accesses/modifies a computer without permission \[[1](https://definitions.uslegal.com/m/malware/)\]. For example, in 2005 Sony got into trouble for bundling a 
copy-protection software with their CDs \[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal)\]. 
When inserted, the CDs would install a [rootkit](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/rootkit) on the operating system level that would prevent the user from
copying the CD. The modification was not mentioned in the [EULA](https://www.servicenow.com/products/it-asset-management/what-is-eula.html) and also introducted
vulnerabilites that other malware exploited. Naturally, the copy-protection was deemed malware and resulted in multiple class-action lawsuits. The most important take-away
was that all of these things were done _without consent_.
