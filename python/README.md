# Welcome to the Most Popular Programming Language: Python!
[Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/) is a high-level programming language is used in everything from AI and data science to websites to GUIs. Over the past
few years, Python has become the most popular programming language ([Tiobe Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)) due to how fast and easy it is to use. You see, Python 
abstracts all the low-level aspects of writing code away from the programmer so they can write what they need to need to without worrying about the internals; you don't have 
to worry about managing memory, declaring types for variables, or sizes for arrays. Python is meant to be one thing above all else: **simple**.
